A PagerDuty Hubot Module
-------------------------

[PagerDuty](http://www.pagerduty.com) is a service that aggregates your
alerting systems and routes them. For example, you can get an alert from nagios
that goes to your Operations team, and another from Airbrake that gets sent to
your devs.

What this script does is integrate your
[Hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot) with the [PagerDuty
API](http://developer.pagerduty.com/).

It provides a few features:

* Ability to retrieve oncall rotation list for the current time
* Poll for incoming incidents and send a message to an "incident room" (e.g., the Operations or Dev Team Rooms) with details.
* Ability to resolve and acknowledge incidents right from chat.
* Ability to set override windows.

More features are coming. This was initially developed in house to scratch an
itch, and others have expressed interest in making use of it.

Requirements and Installation
-----------------------------

Add `hubot-pagerduty` to your hubot's package.json and `npm install`.

Then, copy `node_modules/hubot-pagerduty/src/load_pagerduty.coffee` into your
hubot's scripts/ directory. You will only need to do this once, and will let
you keep current with new updates.

You will also need to create a `pagerdutyrc` at the root of your hubot's path.
This is a JSON object and consists of a few fields:

* `token`: the API token you will use
* `api_subdomain`: the pagerduty subdomain. If you use `foo.pagerduty.com` to login, this will be `foo`.
* `schedules`: this is an array of two-element arrays. Position 0 is the
  schedule name, and position 1 is the schedule ID. If you go to the pagerduty
  website and look at a schedule, this will be the 6 digit alphanumeric code in
  the URL.
* `incident_room`: this is room ID to send notifications on incoming alerts, and will be specific to your chat medium.
* `urgent_page_service_key`: See "Urgent Page Facility" section below.
* `user_map`: a mapping of chat usernames to pagerduty identifiers. Set 'Shell'
  for local testing (that will be the username there). Used in a few commands.

This is parsed with `JSON.parse` which does not allow comments. You've been warned!

Your file should look something like this:

```
{
    "token": "a_big_string_of_characters",
    "schedules": [
      [ "Level 1", "ABCDEFG" ],
      [ "Level 2", "HIJKLMN" ],
      [ "Level 3", "OPQRSTU" ],
      [ "Level 4", "VWXYZ12" ]
    ],
    "incident_room": "1234_xyz@conf.hipchat.com",
    "api_subdomain": "mommas-basement",
    "urgent_page_service_key": "1231231231231231231231",
    "user_map": {
      "erikh": "WAKKAWAK",
      "Shell": "WAKKAWAK",
      "chris": "123DEFAB"
    }
}
```

**(Note to irc users, you will have issues unless you use at least hubot 2.4.7
and hubot-irc 0.1.10)**

Urgent Page Facility
--------------------

The "Urgent Page Facility" allows anybody capable of talking to hubot to create
a new incident. This can be extremely useful when non-technical staff who
interact with the hubot need to alert Operations personnel and your monitoring
system is not catching the issue.

To configure this, you need a "service key" from PagerDuty. To create this:

* Click on the "Services" tab in the PagerDuty UI at the top.
* Click on "Add a New Service"
* Name your service and select the escalation policy these pages will route to.
* Under "Service Type", select "Generic API Service".
* Submit the Form.

On the page that appears next you will see a listing for a "service key", which
is a big string of numbers. That's the value you need to put in your
`pagerdutyrc` under `urgent_page_service_key`.
